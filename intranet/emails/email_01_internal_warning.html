    <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Concerns regarding ARTEMIS protocol deviations</p>

    <p>Members of the Ethics Committee,</p>
    
    <p>Requesting immediate review of current ARTEMIS trial parameters. Recent incident reports (Trials 04 and 05) show unanticipated neuropsychiatric outcomes not reflected in approved documentation.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Key deviations:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Unreported protocol changes increasing vector dosage beyond the last signed amendment.</li>
      <li>Suppression of imaging data showing structural changes inconsistent with reversible modulation.</li>
      <li>Security presence during post-incident interviews, with subjects declining to answer questions after being "reminded of their obligations."</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>I strongly recommend suspension of further infusions until an independent audit is completed. Proceeding under current conditions presents both ethical and legal exposure that goes beyond acceptable research risk.</p>
    
    <p>I am documenting this formally so that there is a record this warning was made.</p>
    
    <p>– Marcus</p>
