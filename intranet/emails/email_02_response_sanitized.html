    <p>Dr. Vale,</p>
    
    <p>Thank you for your diligence and commitment to protocol integrity. Your concerns have been noted and forwarded to the appropriate parties for review.</p>
    
    <p>Preliminary assessment from Compliance and Legal indicates that all current ARTEMIS activities fall within the scope of signed agreements and regulatory allowances. The "deviations" referenced appear to be the result of documentation lag, which will be corrected in the next scheduled update.</p>
    
    <p>You are encouraged to direct any future questions regarding risk thresholds to your project lead and to avoid speculative language in written channels that may be misinterpreted by external auditors.</p>
    
    <p>We appreciate your continued cooperation.</p>
    
    <p>– Compliance Office</p>
