Subject: If anything happens
Status: DRAFT – UNSENT

If you are reading this, it means I failed to convince them from the inside.

The files you found are pieces, not the whole. The logs they let us store on the main servers are curated. The real records are duplicated in places "no one outside will ever look." That's what they told us in the first briefing. They were wrong. You are here.

Look for anything labelled "non-viable outcome." That is the phrase they use when someone does not come back the same. They do not say "dead." They do not say what we see in the observation rooms before Security takes over.

If the interface is doing what I think it is doing, then ARTEMIS is not just changing how subjects think. It is teaching them to see something that was always there but out of human range. When they start to describe the same shapes, the same geometry, using the same words, you will understand why I tried to stop this.

If I disappear, do not trust any message signed with my name that tells you everything is fine.
